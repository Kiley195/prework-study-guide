        <h2>HTML</h2>

        <ul>
          
          <li>The head element contains information abour the webpage.</li>

          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

          <li>Child elements are elements inside of other elements.</li>

          <li>Text, image, header, and list elements are used to add content to a page.</li>

          <li>Meta-related, content division, and semantic elements divide and describe a page.</li>

          <li>Metadata helps the browser render the page correctly, it is not seen by users.</li>

          <li>Headers are h1 - h6, the numbers represent the level of heading. These should be used in order and h1 should only be used once per page.</li>

          <li>Semantic HTML elements: the name of the element indicates role of content as well as providing structure to the content, these should be used where ever possible.</li>

          <li>When adding an image the 'src' attribute defines it's location or source; the 'alt' attribute contains a text string the describes the image. The 'alt' text is important for users using assistive technologies and to help improve search engine rankings.</li>

          <li>'Section' elements define a sectio in a document that contains thematic content.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outsde of an element.</li>

          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content iside an element.</li>

          <li>Inline CSS styles apply to a specific HTML tag to style a particular page element only.</li>

          <li>Internal style sheets are located in the head element, the rules only apply to that page.</li>

          <li>External style sheets are separate files linked in the HTML head element.</li>

          <li>A CSS rule is built from a selector followed by declarations. The selector defines the element or attributes the declarations will apply to.</li>

          <li>Declarations contain two components: the CS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>

          <li>* can be used to apply a rule to ALL elements visible on a page.</li>

          <li>Two or more elements that share the same rule can be grouped together using commas.</li>

          <li>Class attributes allow you to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector. The class attribute can then be assigned to any element you wish to be assigned the CSS rule.</li>

          <li>Using a period before a class designates it as a class selector. Any element assigned to that class will follow the CSS rules applied to the class selector.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript files are executed from top to bottom.</li>
          <li>When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name.</li>
          <li>To execute a function, it must be called in the code.</li>
          <li>An array allows you to store a collection of items under a single variable name, and can contain a mix of data types.</li>
          <li>Arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element in an array is at index 0.</li>
          <li>Strings are used to store text.</li>
          <li>A boolean is a true or false value, most often used in conditional logic.</li>
          <li>Variables can be declared using let, const, or var. Let allows you to reassign the variable. Const declares a variable whose values are never intended to hange, it cannot be reassigned.</li>
          <li>Console.log() outputs the values of what we put inside the parentheses to the console.</li>
          <li>If statements will only execute the code if the statement meets a condition. Else if an be used to introduce more than one condition.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single block of code to executed repeatedly.</li>
          <li>A for loop contains three statements: The first determinse the starting point of the loop (i.e. let x = 0). The second is the condition (i.e. as long as the variable is less than the length of the array x < array.length). The thirdand final allows the array to iterate over each item (i.e. x++) everytime the code lopps x will increase by 1.</li>
